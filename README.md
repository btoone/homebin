Overview
========

A personal collection of `~/bin`.

Some of these scripts are from the excellent PeepCode [Advanced Command
Line](https://peepcode.com/products/advanced-command-line).

Installation
============

    git clone git://github.com/caspyin/homebin.git
    cd homebin
    rake install

Running the rake task will create symbolic links to the scripts in your `~/bin`
directory.

Installers
----------

This project has a few extra installers located in the `installers` directory.
It is recommended that you run each manually but there is also a rake task if
you're feeling lucky.

    rake install:all
