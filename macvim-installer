# TODO Implement MacVim installation script

# download src

# copy app to /Applications

# copy mvim to /usr/local/bin (use sudo)

# create the symlink ln -nfs /usr/local/bin/mvin ~/bin/vim

# NOTES You don't have to create a symlink for vcprompt because /usr/local/bin is in your path.
#       You need a symlink for mvim so it can replace the default install for /usr/bin/vim and
#       you can call it just using "vim"
